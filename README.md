# FlapGod

A fun game for anyone who is serious about flipping pancakes.

This was a project assigned in CSCE 121, the rubric is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vg9tr3krq5vvhy8/project.txt?dl=0.).
It was a group project but I ended up doing everything by myself, except the design for the title screen.

[Flap God 2](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/222607174/flap_god2/index.html ) has been released.

# How to play

Based on the concept of [pancake sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake_sorting), the object of the game is to sort all the pancakes from largest (on the bottom) to smallest (on top) in as few flips as possible.
Click the button of the corresponding pancake to flip it and all of the above pancakes.

# Instructions
