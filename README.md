# FlapGod
A fun game for anyone who is serious about flipping pancakes.

This was a project assigned in CSCE 121, the rubric is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vg9tr3krq5vvhy8/project.txt?dl=0.).
It was a group project but I ended up doing everything by myself, except the design for the title screen.

[Flap God 2](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/222607174/flap_god2/index.html ) has been released.
